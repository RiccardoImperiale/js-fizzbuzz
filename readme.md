# Instructions

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 into the console, but that: 
for numbers multiples of 3 prints “Fizz” 
for numbers multiples of 5 prints "Buzz" 
for numbers multiple of both 3 and 5 prints “FizzBuzz” 

## Bonus 1
Create a container in the DOM, adding (through the append() function) an html element with the correct number or string to display.

## Bonus 2
Apply different styles to the elements added to the DOM depending on whether the value entered is a number, a fizz, a buzz, or a fizzbuzz.

### Pseudo-Code
- Step 1: generate numbers from 1 to 100
- IF a number is a multiple of 3
  - print 'Fizz' 
- IF a number is a multiple of 5
  - print 'Buzz' 
- IF a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5
  - print 'FizzBuzz' 
- Step 2: create a contaier element 
- create an html element using append() with the relative number/string
- Step 3: apply different styles to the elements
